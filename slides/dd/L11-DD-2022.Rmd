- Without randomization $(Z)$, Approaches using quasi-experiments focus on exploiting:

    1.  A treatment group that experiences a **change** in the exposure
        of interest.

    2.  Comparison with an appropriate control group that does not
        experience a change in exposure.

-   Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute
    population (treated and controls):

$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

## One-group pretest-posttest design

-   Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that $Y_{t-1}$ occurs before $Y_{t}$ (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        $Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}$.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.

- Knew Lambeth required to move intake upstream of London *after* 1849.

- SV did not move, and communities were similar in many ways.

- Used SV as an 'unaffected' control community.

- Did not estimate DD parameter, but idea was there.

The simplest DD setting:

-   Outcomes are observed for units observed in one of two groups:

    -   Treated vs. Control

-   Outcomes observed in one of two time periods.

    -   Before and After the intervention.

-   Treated: only units in one of the two groups are exposed to a
    treatment, in the second time period.

-   Control: Never observed to be exposed to the treatment.

## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "gertler1.png"))
```
]

.right-column[

- The average change over time in the non-exposed (control) group is
    subtracted from the change over time in the exposed (treatment)
    group.


- Double differencing removes biases in second period comparisons
    between the treatment and control group that could result from:

  - Fixed (i.e., non time-varying) differences between those groups.
  - Comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the
    result of time trends unrelated to the treatment.
]

---
## Key Assumption: Parallel Trends
.footnote[Impossible to verify (see `r Citet(bib, "Gertler:2011kx")`)]

-   Basic DD controls for any time invariant characteristics of both
    treated and control groups.

-   Does not control for any **time-varying** characteristics.

-   If another policy/intervention occurs in the treated (or control)
    group at the same time as the intervention, we cannot cleanly
    identify the effect of the program.

-   DD main assumption: in the absence of the intervention treated and
    control groups would have displayed similar **trends**.
    
- This is called the *parallel trends* assumption.

## Difference-in-differences (usually) estimates the ATT

-   Our DD model is:
    $Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Treat+\beta_{2}Post+\beta_{3}Treat*Post+\varepsilon$.

    -   we showed that $\beta_{3}$ is the DD estimate in the linear
        model case.

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) absence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{0}|T=1,A=0\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}$

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) presence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{1}|T=1,A=1\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3}$

-   ATT is the expected difference in $Y_{i}^{1}-Y_{i}^{0}$ for those
    treated in the post-period:

    -   $ATT=E\left(Y^{1}-Y^{0}|T=1\right)=\beta_{3}$

### Well...kind of?

- Both designs use untreated groups to estimate the counterfactual for the treated group.

- Simple 2x2 DD study does not require any time series data.

- CITS often assesses impact on step change and slope.

- DD often estimates average effect in post period.

- Both can incorporate longer time series and dynamic effects.

## Extending the model to multiple groups/times
-   The regression model with group and time fixed effects would now
    look something like this (where $\color{red}{\beta_{5}}$ is the DD estimate where policy=1):

$$Y_{gt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}g2+\beta_{2}g3+\beta_{3}t2+\beta_{4}t3+\color{red}{\beta_{5}}p_{gt}+\varepsilon_{st}$$

- Reference categories (for interpreting $\beta_{0}$) are group 1 $(g1)$ and time 1 $(t1)$.

--

- More generally, you could write the basic equation with multiple
    group $(\gamma_{g})$ and time $(\tau_{t})$ fixed effects as:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} p_{gt}+\varepsilon_{st}$$
where $\color{red}{\delta^{DD}}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate for groups treated at time t.

- Note that our basic regression model assumes the only time-varying
factor is the policy:
$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} p_{gt}+ \varepsilon_{gt}$$
-   What if there are confounders of the decision to change the policy?

-   That is, we may have omitted important factors that:
    - differ by treatment status.
    - affect the outcome.
    - **are time-varying**, but not affected by the treatment $(TVC)$.
]

---
### Extending the basic 2x2 DD: adding time-varying covariates

-   E.g., suppose the policy is a soft drink tax and the outcome
    calories consumed (linear).

-   We might worry that *changes in* the density of fast food restaurants could be a
    common cause of both. We can account for any measured time-varying
    confounders:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} p_{gt}+ \zeta Z_{gt}+\varepsilon_{gt}$$

-   where $\zeta Z_{gt}$ is a vector of other controls at the cluster
    level.

-   Important especially if you think other policies may have been
    implemented simultaneously with treatment.

-   Now, conditional on FEs and $\zeta Z_{gt}$, we assume that the
    timing of the change in policy is as good as random.

---
## Assessing heterogeneity
-   DD design can also easily be extended to assess differential impact
    by social group.

-   Often of policy interest to assess whether program impacts may
    differ by:

    -   gender.
    -   socioeconomic position.
    -   disadvantage.
    -   levels of the outcome.

--

- Easy to extend the model to include product term between treatment
    and "group" of interest.
  - Remember that the treatment varies by time and cluster!
  - So must include all two-way interaction terms with fixed effects.

## Evaluating impact on inequalities

-   Compared MA to nearby states: NY, NJ, PA.

-   Intervention "worked": % uninsured halved (12% to 6%) from 2004-06
    to 2008-09.

```


---
## Extensions to non-binary treatments

DD design can also handle treatments/policies/exposures that are not
dichotomous.

Examples:

-   Changes in minimum wage levels (varying "treatment" intensity)

    -   Estimate varying levels of increase ($2 increase vs. $4)

-   "Sin" taxes (e.g., alcohol or cigarettes).

    -   differential changes in excise taxes (smaller vs. larger).

-   "Weaker" vs. "Stronger" policies

    -   texting while driving (primary vs. secondary offense)

    -   thresholds for blood alcohol limits (0.15 vs. 0.10 vs. 0.08).
    
---
## Dynamic Effects
.right-column[
- Basic DD estimates the average ATT over the post-intervention period.

- May average over important variations in how the treatment evolves over time.

- Was the impact immediate? Transient? Sustained over time?

--

.pull-right[
### What to do?
- Allow the impact of the treatment to vary over time.

## A note about scale
- Parallel trends is an assumption about how the *size* of the gap between treated and control would have evolved in the absence of treatment.

- Do you care about absolute or relative effects?

## Evaluating Prior Trends
.footnote[See recent work by `r Citet(bib, "Rambachan:2019wf")` and `r Citet(bib, "Roth:2020uk")`.]
- Can test whether *pre-intervention* trends differ between treated and control groups.

- Using only pre-intervention data, run:
$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \beta_{gt}Group*Time$$ 
- Tests of $\beta$ here can be instructive about prior trends.

- Caveats regarding sample sizes and substantive interpretations of any differences. 
  - Can find 'significant' but tiny differences with large sample size.
  - Important differences but imprecise so not 'significant'.
  - Mostly consistent but 1 period different?
  
---
## Difference-in-difference-in-differences (yes, this exists.)

-   A difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) model allows us to
    study the effect of treatment on different groups.

-   If we are concerned that our estimated treatment effect might be
    spurious, a common robustness test is to introduce a comparison
    group that should not be affected by the treatment.

-   For example, if a policy is designed to affect teenagers we can use
    a DD model that takes advantage of policy variation across states,
    and then use a DDD model to study how the policy has affected
    younger versus older individuals.

-   Assuming no true spillover effects.

### Recall the setup for DD regression with multiple treated groups

We have different units that are exposed to our intervention at different times. We often use OLS (or LPM) to fit:
$$y_{gt} = \alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \beta^{DD}{p_{gt}} + \epsilon_{gt}$$
### where
- $y_{it}$ is the outcome for unit $i$ at time $t$.
- $\gamma_{g}$ are group-specific fixed effects.
- $\tau_{t}$ are fixed effects for each time period.
- $p_{gt}$ is a time-varying treatment indicator.
- $\beta^{DD}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate.

## What is the problem?
.right-column[

- Using earlier treated groups as controls only 'works' if the treatment effects are:
  - Homogeneous across groups at a given time; and
  - Homogeneous over time (no dynamic effects).

- This adds any changes in treatment effects in the early group, which get .red[subtracted from the DD estimate.]

- Can lead to $\beta^{DD}$ that is a poor summary of group-specific effects if there is heterogeneity.
]


---
## What are potential solutions?
.footnote[Many new papers on this. See recent papers by `r Citet(bib, "Callaway:2021vd")`, `r Citet(bib, "Goodman-Bacon:2021va")`, `r Citet(bib, "Cengiz:2019vw")` and `r Citet(bib, "Sun:2021vm")`]

- All basically involve .red[not allowing] early treated groups to serve as controls later.

### Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)
#### Use non-parametric group-time ATTs (+ covariates).

### Abraham and Sun (2021)
#### Use saturated fixed effects to ensure that prior treated units are not used as controls

### Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer (2019)
#### Create state-event-specific panel datasets and calculate event-specific estimates using separate regressions for each state-event.

.left-column[
## Key Takeaways
]

.right-column[
- DD is a common and powerful design to estimate policy and program impacts.

- Compares *changes* in outcomes in a treated group to a control group.

- Controls for time-invariant unobserved group factors *and* common trends in outcomes.

- Requires good qualitative knowledge about *why* the treated group became treated.

- Core assumption is parallel trends, unverifiable but not impossible to investigate.

- Many extensions possible (inequalities, multiple groups and periods, non-binary treatments).
