-   Approaches using quasi-experiments focus on exploiting:

    1.  A treatment group that experiences a **change** in the exposure
        of interest.

    2.  Comparison with an appropriate control group that does not
        experience a change in exposure.

-   Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute
    population (treated and controls):

$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

## One-group pretest-posttest design

-   Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that $Y_{t-1}$ occurs before $Y_{t}$ (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        $Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}$.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.

>"In many cases a single house has a supply different from that on either side. Each company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different companies..."


- Treatment groups lacked knowledge of mechanisms, or intervention:

>"divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge"

## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea

.right-column[

The simplest DD setting:

-   Outcomes are observed for units observed in one of two groups:

    -   Treated vs. Control

-   Outcomes observed in one of two time periods.

    -   Before and After the intervention.

-   Treated: only units in one of the two groups are exposed to a
    treatment, in the second time period.

-   Control: Never observed to be exposed to the treatment.

### DD Basics
]

.right-column[
### Treated vs. Control
#### Outcomes are observed for units observed in one of two groups

### Pre- vs. Post-Intervention
#### Outcomes observed in one of two time periods
]

---
## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea

-   The average change over time in the non-exposed (control) group is
    subtracted from the change over time in the exposed (treatment)
    group.

--

-   Double differencing removes biases in second period comparisons
    between the treatment and control group that could result from:

1.  Fixed (i.e., non time-varying) differences between those groups.

2.  Comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the
    result of time trends unrelated to the treatment.
    
---
## Key Assumption: Parallel Trends
.footnote[Impossible to verify (see `r Citet(bib, "Gertler:2011kx")`)]

-   Basic DD controls for any time invariant characteristics of both
    treated and control groups.

-   Does not control for any **time-varying** characteristics.

-   If another policy/intervention occurs in the treated (or control)
    group at the same time as the intervention, we cannot cleanly
    identify the effect of the program.

-   DD main assumption: in the absence of the intervention treated and
    control groups would have displayed similar **trends**.

### Kind of?

- Both designs use untreated groups to estimate the counterfactual for the treated group.

- Simple 2x2 DD study does not require any time series data.

- CITS often assesses impact on step change and slope.

- DD often estimates average effect in post period.

- Both can incorporate longer time series and dynamic effects.

]
---
## Difference-in-differences (usually) estimates the ATT

-   Our DD model is:
    $Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Treat+\beta_{2}After+\beta_{3}Treat*After+\varepsilon$.

    -   we showed that $\beta_{3}$ is the DD estimate in the linear
        model case.

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) absence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{0}|T=1,A=0\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}$

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) presence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{1}|T=1,A=1\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3}$

-   ATT is the expected difference in $Y_{i}^{1}-Y_{i}^{0}$ for those
    treated in the post-period:

    -   $ATT=E\left(Y^{1}-Y^{0}|T=1\right)=\beta_{3}$

.left-column[
Express our earlier model using 'fixed effects':

- Dummy for Group

- Dummy for Time

- *Time-varying* policy indicator
]

.right-column[

$$Y = \color{blue}{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*Group2} + \color{red}{\beta_{2}*Time2} +   \color{green}{\beta_{3}*policy}$$

y | group | time | treat? | post? | treatXpost | Group 2 | Time 2 | policy
--|--|--|--|--|--|
$\vdots$  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
$\vdots$  | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | .red[1] | 0
$\vdots$  | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | .blue[1] | 0 | 0 
$\vdots$  | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | .green[1] | .green[1] | .green[1]

- $\color{green}{\beta_{3}}$ still estimates the 'difference-in-differences' parameter.

## What about multiple treated groups?
- Easy to rewrite our earlier model for multiple groups **treated at the same time**

- 3 units and 3 time periods.
- Groups 1 and 3 implement policy at .green[T2].

- .blue[g2] and .blue[g3] are dummies for group 2 and 3
- .red[t2] and .red[t3] are respective time dummies for periods 2 and 3.
]

.pull-right[
y | group | time | policy | g2 | g3 | t2 | t3 
--|--|--|--|--|--|
$\vdots$  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 
$\vdots$  | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | .red[1] | 0 
$\vdots$  | 1 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | .red[1] 
$\vdots$  | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
$\vdots$  | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | .red[1] | 0 
$\vdots$  | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | .red[1] 
$\vdots$  | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 
$\vdots$  | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | .red[1] | 0 
$\vdots$  | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | .red[1]

## Extending the model to multiple groups/times
-   The regression model with group and time fixed effects would now
    look something like this (where $\color{red}{\beta_{5}}$ is the DD estimate where policy=1):

$$Y_{gt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}g2+\beta_{2}g3+\beta_{3}t2+\beta_{4}t3+\color{red}{\beta_{5}}p_{gt}+\varepsilon_{st}$$

- Reference categories (for interpreting $\beta_{0}$) are group 1 $(g1)$ and time 1 $(t1)$.

--

- More generally, you could write the basic equation with multiple
    group $(\gamma_{g})$ and time $(\tau_{t})$ fixed effects as:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta_{DD}} p_{gt}+\varepsilon_{st}$$
where $\color{red}{\delta_{DD}}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate for groups treated at time t.

## Example
.pull-left[
- Pre-post comparison vastly overestimates the effect.
]

.pull-right[
```{r twfe, echo=F}
od <- causaldata::organ_donations

# Treatment variable
od <- od %>%
     mutate(Treated = State == 'California' & 
            Quarter %in% c('Q32011','Q42011','Q12012'),
            Ever_Trt = State == 'California')

# feols clusters by the first
# fixed effect by default, no adjustment necessary
clfe <- feols(Rate ~ Treated | State + Quarter,
           data = od)
pp <- feols(Rate ~ Treated | Quarter, data=od, cluster = "State")
tu <- feols(Rate ~ Ever_Trt, data=od, cluster = "State")

models <- list("Pre-post" = pp, "Treated vs. Not" = tu,
               "DD" = clfe) 
coefs <- c('TreatedTRUE' = "Policy", 'Ever_Trt' = "Treated" )
msummary(models, coef_map = coefs,
  statistic = c("({std.error})",
                "[{conf.low}, {conf.high}]"),
  gof_omit = 'DF|Deviance|R2|AIC|BIC|Log.Lik|ICC|RMSE')
```

## What if I need covariates?
.footnote[See `r Citet(bib, "Caetano:2022ta")` for more details.]
- In theory, it is easy to 'extend' our TWFE model to allow for covariates:

### Recall the setup for DD regression with multiple treated groups
.right-column[
We have different units that are exposed to our intervention at different times. We often use OLS (or LPM) to fit:
$$y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \tau_{t} + \beta^{DD}{D_{it}} + \epsilon_{it}$$
### where
- $y_{it}$ is the outcome for unit $i$ at time $t$.
- $\alpha_{i}$ are unit-specific fixed effects.
- $\tau_{t}$ are fixed effects for each time period.
- $D_{it}$ is a time-varying treatment indicator.
- $\beta^{DD}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate.
