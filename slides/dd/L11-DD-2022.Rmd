## Thinking about research design

-   Approaches using natural or quasi-experiments focus on exploiting:

    1.  A treatment group that experiences a **change** in the exposure
        of interest.

    2.  Comparison with an appropriate control group that does not
        experience a change in exposure.

-   Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute
    population (treated and controls):

$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

## One-group pretest-posttest design

-   Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that $Y_{t-1}$ occurs before $Y_{t}$ (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        $Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}$.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.
    
---
## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea

The simplest DD setting:

-   Outcomes are observed for units observed in one of two groups:

    -   Treated vs. Control

-   Outcomes observed in one of two time periods.

    -   Before and After the intervention.

-   Treated: only units in one of the two groups are exposed to a
    treatment, in the second time period.

-   Control: Never observed to be exposed to the treatment.

---
## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea

-   The average change over time in the non-exposed (control) group is
    subtracted from the change over time in the exposed (treatment)
    group.

--

-   Double differencing removes biases in second period comparisons
    between the treatment and control group that could result from:

1.  Fixed (i.e., non time-varying) differences between those groups.

2.  Comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the
    result of time trends unrelated to the treatment.
    
---
## Key Assumption: Parallel Pre-Intervention Trends
.footnote[Impossible to verify (see `r Citet(bib, "Gertler:2011kx")`)]

-   Basic DD controls for any time invariant characteristics of both
    treated and control groups.

-   Does not control for any **time-varying** characteristics.

-   If another policy/intervention occurs in the treated (or control)
    group at the same time as the intervention, we cannot cleanly
    identify the effect of the program.

-   DD main assumption: in the absence of the intervention treated and
    control groups would have displayed similar **trends**.

-   Evaluated impact of MA reform on hospital admissions.

-   Compared MA to nearby states: NY, NJ, PA.

-   Intervention "worked": % uninsured halved (12% to 6%) from 2004-06
    to 2008-09.

## Difference-in-Differences without Regression
.pull-left[
DD is just differences in means! Let $\mu_{it}=E(Y_{it})$

- $i=0$ is control group, $i=1$ is treatment.

- $t=0$ is pre-period, $t=1$ is post-period.

- One 'difference' estimate of causal effect is: $\mu_{11}-\mu_{10}$ (pre-post in treated)

]

.pull-right[

- Differences-in-Differences estimate of causal effect is: $(\mu_{11}-\mu_{10})-(\mu_{01}-\mu_{00})$

Area   |     Before     |  After  | Difference |
---------| ---------------| -------| --------------------|
Treated  |      135     |    100    |       -35 |
Control   |     80     |     60     |       -20 |
