## Thinking about research design

-   Approaches using quasi-experiments focus on exploiting:

    1.  A treatment group that experiences a **change** in the exposure
        of interest.

    2.  Comparison with an appropriate control group that does not
        experience a change in exposure.

-   Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute
    population (treated and controls):

`$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$`

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

## One-group pretest-posttest design

-   Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that `\(Y_{t-1}\)` occurs before `\(Y_{t}\)` (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        `\(Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}\)`.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## Adding pretests for both groups

]

---
## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.

- Couldn't randomize.

- Knew Lambeth required to move intake upstream of London *after* 1849.

- SV did not move, and communities were similar in many ways.

- Used SV as an 'unaffected' control community.

- Did not estimate DD parameter, but idea was there.

## Why is Snow's work compelling?

- Evidence of pre-treatment equivalence between groups:

&gt;"In many cases a single house has a supply different from that on either side. Each company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different companies..."


- Treatment groups lacked knowledge of mechanisms, or intervention:

&gt;"divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge"

## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea

.right-column[

The simplest DD setting:

-   Outcomes are observed for units observed in one of two groups:

    -   Treated vs. Control

-   Outcomes observed in one of two time periods.

    -   Before and After the intervention.

-   Treated: only units in one of the two groups are exposed to a
    treatment, in the second time period.

-   Control: Never observed to be exposed to the treatment.

### Treated vs. Control

]

---
## Difference-in-Differences: Basic Idea

-   The average change over time in the non-exposed (control) group is
    subtracted from the change over time in the exposed (treatment)
    group.

--

-   Double differencing removes biases in second period comparisons
    between the treatment and control group that could result from:

1.  Fixed (i.e., non time-varying) differences between those groups.

2.  Comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the
    result of time trends unrelated to the treatment.
    
---
## Key Assumption: Parallel Trends
.footnote[Impossible to verify (see [Gertler, et al. (2011)](#bib-Gertler2011kx))]

-   Basic DD controls for any time invariant characteristics of both
    treated and control groups.

-   Does not control for any **time-varying** characteristics.

-   If another policy/intervention occurs in the treated (or control)
    group at the same time as the intervention, we cannot cleanly
    identify the effect of the program.

-   DD main assumption: in the absence of the intervention treated and
    control groups would have displayed similar **trends**.

## Wait ... isn't this just "Controlled" ITS (CITS)?
.footnote[See the exchange between [Benmarhnia, et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyz049) and [Lopez Bernal, et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyz050) for more.]

.right-column[
### Kind of?

- Both designs use untreated groups to estimate the counterfactual for the treated group.

- Simple 2x2 DD study does not require any time series data.

- CITS often assesses impact on step change and slope.

- DD often estimates average effect in post period.

- Both can incorporate longer time series and dynamic effects.

]
---
## Difference-in-differences (usually) estimates the ATT

-   Our DD model is:
    `\(Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Treat+\beta_{2}After+\beta_{3}Treat*After+\varepsilon\)`.

    -   we showed that `\(\beta_{3}\)` is the DD estimate in the linear
        model case.

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) absence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   `\(E\left(Y_{i}^{0}|T=1,A=0\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}\)`

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) presence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   `\(E\left(Y_{i}^{1}|T=1,A=1\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3}\)`

-   ATT is the expected difference in `\(Y_{i}^{1}-Y_{i}^{0}\)` for those
    treated in the post-period:

    -   `\(ATT=E\left(Y^{1}-Y^{0}|T=1\right)=\beta_{3}\)`

## Extending the model to multiple groups/times
-   The regression model with group and time fixed effects would now
    look something like this (where `\(\color{red}{\beta_{5}}\)` is the DD estimate where policy=1):

`$$Y_{gt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}g2+\beta_{2}g3+\beta_{3}t2+\beta_{4}t3+\color{red}{\beta_{5}}p_{gt}+\varepsilon_{st}$$`

- Reference categories (for interpreting `\(\beta_{0}\)`) are group 1 `\((g1)\)` and time 1 `\((t1)\)`.

--

- More generally, you could write the basic equation with multiple
    group `\((\gamma_{g})\)` and time `\((\tau_{t})\)` fixed effects as:

`$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta_{DD}} p_{gt}+\varepsilon_{st}$$`
where `\(\color{red}{\delta_{DD}}\)` is the difference-in-differences estimate for groups treated at time t.

## What if I need covariates?
.footnote[See [Caetano, et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02903) for more details.]
- In theory, it is easy to 'extend' our TWFE model to allow for covariates:

### Recall the setup for DD regression with multiple treated groups
.right-column[
We have different units that are exposed to our intervention at different times. We often use OLS (or LPM) to fit:
`$$y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \tau_{t} + \beta^{DD}{D_{it}} + \epsilon_{it}$$`
### where
- `\(y_{it}\)` is the outcome for unit `\(i\)` at time `\(t\)`.
- `\(\alpha_{i}\)` are unit-specific fixed effects.
- `\(\tau_{t}\)` are fixed effects for each time period.
- `\(D_{it}\)` is a time-varying treatment indicator.
- `\(\beta^{DD}\)` is the difference-in-differences estimate.
